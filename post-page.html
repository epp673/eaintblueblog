        <h2 class="sub-heading">500 days of summer</h2>
        <p class="post-description">If you're a happy-ending enjoyer, this film might be disappointed to you. 
            But it is a relief to have a film that tackles the painful side of romance, and this one has its good points. 
            
            This movie is let down by sitcom cliches, and by being weirdly incurious about the inner life of its female lead, Summer Finn.
            Her jokey,</p>
            <p class="post-description">flirtatious relationship between the male lead, Tom is based on a shared love of British bands such as the Smiths and on a giggly, conspiratorial feeling of superiority to the silliness and phoniness of everything that surrounds them. But the relationship, which lasts 500 days, is doomed, and Tom, the male lead, plays</p>
            <p class="post-description">us scenes from random days, out of narrative order, to illustrate the painful business. The problem seems to be that he believes in love and she doesn't. Or is it that she just doesn't believe in being in love with him?
            
                Agonisingly, Summer ends the relationship and appears relatively serene about it, asking if they can't be "friends" – always a shatter</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">About Time</h2>
        <p class="post-description">The movie's plot is emotionally intense, focusing on the importance of cherishing every moment of our lives with our beloved ones. The story is about Tim, a 21-year-old man who is unlucky in love and discovers that the men in his family have always had the ability to travel back in time.</p>
        <p class="post-description">Using his ability to travel back in time, he tries to make the best out of every day. However, unfortunate time-travel problems can happen. Going back in time will not be the same every time. The plot continues as he meets Mary, played by Rachel McAdams, who later becomes his wife. Tim uses his power to fix his mistakes,</p>
        <p class="post-description">ensuring a happy life with Mary and his loved ones. Yet, his unusual gift cannot save him from the sorrow and the unavoidable fact of death. The most emotional scene for me is the last scene, where he turns back time to live his life as a kid with his dad again. This scene was incredibly touching and it made me cry.</p>
        <p class="post-description">	The movie's storytelling is outstanding, and the director has done a great job of keeping the audience engaged from beginning to end. The way the story runs and continues is so unique, and every scene where Tim goes back in time to fix incidents is reasonable. I think the movie shows how we can all learn to enjoy every second with our loved ones. It is so touching.</p>
            <p class="post-description">The movie's story is simple and well-organized. The casting is excellent, bringing the story to life. If you are looking for a heartwarming movie that will leave you feeling happy and fulfilled, About Time is for you.</p>

            주인공 지연이 너무 안쓰러워서 그만 기다리고 놓는 게 좋지 않을까 하고 생각 할 법도 한데 아마 엔딩을 보시면 둘의 사랑을 응원하 게 될 겁니다.
            
            내용도 신선나고 주인공 둘의 감정 사이에서 같이 헤엄치는 느낌이 들고 잔잔한 사랑의 파도가 마음에 너울을 일으켜 줄 좋은 글입니다</p>

        <p class="post-description">Like many a smitten introvert, she wants to be honest about her feelings, but she doesn’t know how to act.

            Overall, Bye Bye My Blue is a quiet melody, one that passes through the ears easily and ends all too soon. There’s no bridge, no hook, and instead the track relies on the refrains of piano to fill the gaps. Yet, in so few words and notes,</p>
          <p class="post-description"> Bye Bye My Blue manages to communicate the complex sentiments of affection and longing quite well.</p>

            대충 내용은 그런데 나중에 한국 시기가 좋을때 로코 장르 백합 드라마화로 나와도 괜찮을 것 같은 글이다. 꼭 그렇게 되길 바란다.</p>
